# DL-wine-quality

## The Mission: 

Using AI predict the quality of a wine.

### Mission Objectives: 
- Use a deep learning library: Keras was used 
- Prepare a data set for a machine learning model:  
-    Steps taken where:
-    1- Understanding The Data: the description of each of the wine features  
-    2- Loaded the wine.csv data: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/becodeorg/GNT-Arai-    2.31/master/content/additional_resources/datasets/Wine%20Quality/wine.csv?token=AUDYZYYNMMIDYPJJ34NKHN3BICUH4'
-    3- Data Exploration: the highlight from the describe is that the difference between the minimum and maximum of some of the features is too high 
-    4- Visualizing The Data: with highlighting the correlation to see the most related 
- Put together a simple neural network
- Tune parameters of a neural network
